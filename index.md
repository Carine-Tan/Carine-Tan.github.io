### Capstone Project 0.1 [26-November-2020]

Capstone 0.1: Basic of Data Science - Research Presentation

"Research on articles about topics covered during the class:  
• Look for practical applications/use cases of data science   
• Identify the different aspects of the basics of data science application to that selected articles"

My Experience: Lesson learnt from Capstone 0.1, these presentation slides are kept simple, keypoints in bullet forms and also did practice runs before the actual presentation day.

Interesting Facts: Slide 3 the 'Design/Development cycle' & the concept of 'Uniqueness' were inspired when watching NCC Zone X 2020 online.

My Experience: The ideas didn't come all at once when I started on this Project. In actual fact, I started without a storyline. Things were in bits and pieces, yet God creatively put all these bits together, making it flow logically with none of my efforts and time put in go to waste. **YESHUA Is Good All The Time!**

Alias: 'The Most God's Ideas!'

My Experience: This is my favourite of the 5 projects! Though throughout the preparation even up till presentation, I had the constant nagging feeling that it is missing something - I've not figured out what it is. Hopefully, someday I would! 

My Audacity: I asked God to 'patent' the ideas in this project; No other will wrangle the data like I did! O-O #Originator

My Experience: Played it very safe on the selection of my dataset (a manageable one) in view of the tight timeline and lack of adequacy in Algorithms in Python. Also picked the most uncommonly used color theme in presentations, 'Pink!', and 'Family' as my theme for this project.

Truth Be Told: Too much of pink can be overwhelming! Not my best project!
